## I'm Caitlin J. Baxendale.

# I do editing across a variety of genres and mediums for clients all across the world.

I'm an advocate for less standardisation and prescriptivism in our approaches to language. ESL (English as a Second Language) speakers are welcome to contact me for my editorial services.

I aim for accessibility always. If my website presents accessibility problems to you, let me know and I will endeavour to improve this for you. My goals are to comply with current web accessibility standards in all regards.
