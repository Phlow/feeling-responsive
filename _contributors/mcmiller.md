Mark has supported [VisIt](http://visit.llnl.gov) and led development of
[Silo](https://silo.llnl.gov) supporting scalable I/O requirements of LLNL HPC simulation codes such as
[ALE3D](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes/ale3d)
[Kull, Ares, LASNEX and Overlink](https://wci.llnl.gov/simulation/computer-codes)
for ~20 years.
Mark's interests include data models and their impact on software
interoperability, high performance I/O, and Software Quality Engineering
([Smart Libraries](https://wci.llnl.gov/codes/smartlibs/UCRL-JRNL-208636.pdf))
for HPC libraries.  In this role, Mark has participated in the development of
a number of scientific
database and data modeling technologies including
[Silo](http://silo.llnl.gov),
[HDF5](https://support.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/),
[SAF](https://github.com/markcmiller86/SAF), and
[ITAPS](https://github.com/markcmiller86/ITAPS/blob/master/docs/Presentations/ITAPS_SC08_Tutorial_Submitted.pdf)
and most recently the
[MACSio](https://codesign.llnl.gov/macsio.php)
scalable I/O proxy application.
