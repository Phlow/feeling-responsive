  description: The Flensburg University of Applied Sciences (FUAS) is part of the Center for Sustainable Energy Systems (ZNES). It provides valuable expertise in modeling and planning of sub-transmission and transmission grids including the development and application of methods for complexity reductions. Furthermore, the FUAS can build on profound knowledge in processing data for energy system modeling.  In the context of eGo<sup>n</sup>, the FUAS works on the expansion of the grid planning tool focusing on the high and extra-high voltage level. This includes the integration of e-mobility and advanced electrical flexibilities. Additionally, the FUAS is in charge of the overall project coordination.
