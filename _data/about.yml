  info: Founder and current guild leader of **Atemosta**. I am a software developer by day and a HUGE virtual enthusiast at all other times! My dream is to make something like **Sword Art Online** as real as possible (minus the lethality, though no guarantees). I also run the blogs **Evolution of Experience** and **VR Developer Diaries** regarding my journey witnessing and creating various AR/VR Worlds.

  info: Author and blogger for **Atemosta**. I am creator of the series **Perfecting Your Protagonist**, a blog exploring heroic tropes in literature and my journey in implementing those characteristics into my everyday life. My favorite anime is **Re:Creators** as is one of the truest love letters to the creative writing process no matter what medium an author battles in.
