VisIt can plot curves from data read from files and it can be used to extract 
and plot curve data from higher dimensional datasets using lineout operators or 
queries. The curves in the featured image correspond to elevation data along 
lines drawn on DEM data and were created using VisIt's lineout capability. 
Lineout allows you to interactively draw a line which specfies a path for data 
extraction. The resulting data was then plotted as curves.
