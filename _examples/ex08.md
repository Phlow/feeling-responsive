title: "Plot of YF-17 Aircraft"
---

The featured image displays plots of a
[CGNS dataset](http://www.cgns.org/CGNSFiles/Bruce/yf17.cgns.gz) representing a
YF-17 jet aircraft. The dataset consists of an unstructured grid with solution.
VisIt created the image using a pseudocolor plot of the dataset's Mach variable,
a mesh plot of the grid, and vector plot of a slice through the velocity field.
VisIt 1.5 and later can read CGNS files.

The dataset was provided by the CGNS user community's
[Example Files](http://www.cgns.org/CGNSFiles.html) page.
