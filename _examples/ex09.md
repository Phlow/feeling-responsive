The featured plot shows Leaf Area Index (LAI), a measure of global
vegetative matter, from a NetCDF dataset. The primary plot is the
large plot at the bottom, which shows the LAI for the whole world.
The plots on top are actually annotations that contain images that
VisIt generated earlier. Image annotations can be used to include
material that enhances a visualization such as auxiliary plots,
images of experimental data, project logos, etc. The data in the
featured image was obtained via the Internet from
[NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/)
