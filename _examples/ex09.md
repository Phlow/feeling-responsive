The featured plot shows Leaf Area Index (LAI), a measure of global vegetative
matter, from a NetCDF dataset. The primary plot is the large plot at the bottom,
which shows the LAI for the whole world. The plots on top are actually
annotations that contain images that VisIt generated earlier. Image annotations
can be used to include material that enhances a visualization such as auxiliary
plots, images of experimental data, project logos, etc.
