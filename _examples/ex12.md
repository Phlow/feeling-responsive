This visualization uses various plots to show the geometry and flow induced by 
heating of a coil inside a cylinder with solution. The input
[dataset](http://www.cgns.org/CGNSFiles/CFX/HeatingCoil.cgns.gz) is an 
unstructured mesh (mixed element types) stored in [CGNS](http://www.cgns.org/)
format.  The streamlines show the flow through the solution.
