VisIt can read several file formats common in the field of Geographic 
Information Systems (GIS), allowing you to incorporate raster and vector data 
from multiple sources in a single visualization. The featured image shows a top 
view (zoomed in) of Livermore, CA, with roads superimposed and labeled on top 
of colors corresponding to elevation.
