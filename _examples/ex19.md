VisIt's general plotting capabilities were used to create the molecular 
rendering shown in the featured visualization. The original data was taken from 
the [Protein Data Bank](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/) and turned into a
[VTK](https://vtk.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/file-formats.pdf) file before
rendering in VisIt.
