VisIt's Scatter plot allows you to visualize multivariate data of up to four 
dimensions. The Scatter plot takes multiple scalar variables and uses them for 
different axes in phase space. The different variables are combined to form 
coordinates in the phase space and they are displayed using glyphs and colored 
using another scalar variable.
