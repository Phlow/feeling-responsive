The featured plot is a slightly zoomed in view of a Pseudocolor plot of laser 
filamentation from a 12.7 billion cell (per time step) rectilinear grid dataset 
created at LLNL. The dataset is the largest dataset processed with VisIt to 
date. When the dataset is plotted in VisIt, you can zoom in on the image three 
more times from this view before you can even see the individual computational 
cells. VisIt rendered different views of the dataset every 2-3 seconds using 
400 processors of LLNL's Thunder supercomputer.
