title: Elevated Texture 
image: gallery-27.jpg
---
The featured image contains a Truecolor plot that has been elevated using the 
Elevate operator to create the VisIt 1.5 splashscreen. Two JPEG images were 
used (one for the texture and one for the height map used for the Elevate 
operator). The height image, which contains the design, was mapped onto the 
texture image's mesh using the conn_cmfe expression. The resulting height field 
was then used to elevate the texture image.
