The DJEHUTY stellar evolution code was used to calcuate the explosion of SN 
1987A model in three dimensions, including the production and distribution of 
radioactive Ni-56, which powers most of the light emanating after the first few 
days. The explosion was initiated by placing 2 Ã— 1051 ergs of energy within the 
innermost 150 km of the model. The initial density field was perturbed 10% to 
allow instabilities to grow, which is mandated by observations. Self-gravity 
was run in the spherical approximation but was centered on a self-consistently 
calculated center of mass. The simulation encompassed the whole star, contained 
11 million cells, and was run on 512 processors of LLNL's Frost supercomputer 
for 36 hours. The resulting dataset was approximately 2 terabytes.
