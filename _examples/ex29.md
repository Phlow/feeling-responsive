title: Integrated 3D HYDRA Simulation of a NIF Target 
image: gallery-29.jpg
---
The featured visualization shows the motion of materials and the paths of laser 
rays in a 3D HYDRA simulation of a NIF ignition target. The simulation models 
the entire target, including all of the relevant features and the detailed 
laser illumination pattern. It was performed on LLNL's massively parallel IBM 
ASC Frost platform. The image's left window shows a cut away view of the 
material boundaries. Representative rays from two pairs of the laser beams are 
shown in red and green. These burn through the hohlraum window and fill gas 
(not shown).

Once they reach the hohlraum wall their energy is efficiently converted to
x-rays which heat the capsule. The upper right window shows a cut away view of
the capsule ablator and fuel boundaries. The fuel region converges until
ignition time, and then undergoes rapid expansion.
