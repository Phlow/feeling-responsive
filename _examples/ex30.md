VisIt was used to visualize the results from the
[SAMRAI simulation framework](http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/SAMRAI/) of 
an atmospheric anomaly in and around Times Square. A high resolution satellite 
image of Manhattan was combined with the visualization to provide visual 
context. In addition, to add realism during the fly-through sequence, VisIt 
uses a sky-blue background and renders the buildings with shadows. In the final 
sequence showing a slice through the anomaly at ground level, VisIt's 
expression feature is used to render a few quantization levels of interest.
