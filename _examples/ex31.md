title: Large-Eddy Simulation of Raleigh-Taylor Instability 
image: gallery-31.jpg
---
The visualization depicts a large-eddy simulation of Raleigh-Taylor 
instability at an Atwood number of 1/2. The simulation was conducted on a 720 × 
720 × 1620 point grid using 1620 processors, taking 20 days, and generating 20 
terabytes of data.
