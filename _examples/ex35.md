[Finite Volume Coastal Ocean Model](http://www.smast.umassd.edu/Fisheries/modelerFV/aboutFVCOM.php)
is a prognostic, unstructured-grid, free-surface, 3D primitive equation
coastal ocean circulation model developed at UMASSD and WHOI. VisIt
draws [FVCOM](https://wiki.fvcom.pml.ac.uk/doku.php) data from a 2-year
Gulf of Maine simulation during a rising tide in August of 1999. The
bathymetry is shown in gray while the sea surface is transparent blue.
A surface of constant density (1025 kg m3) is transparent orange with its
intersection on two vertical sections is shown in black. The vectors show
a few of the model velocities on the constant density surface as the rising
tide rushes in to fill the gulf of Maine.
