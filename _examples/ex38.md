This figure shows the first steps of growth of a nonlinear zonal flow
in a PIC numerical simulation of gyrokinetic ion-temperature-gradient
(ITG) turbulence in a tokamak fusion plasma.

The data used in the visualization were produced using the UCAN
gyrokinetic code at the ARSC supercomputers located at the
University of Alaska, Fairbanks.
