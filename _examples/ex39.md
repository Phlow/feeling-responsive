Computer simulation of dendritic growth in a cooling Al+Cu alloy. We have
simulated a cube with a side length of 0.2125 mm consisting of liquid
aluminum mixed with 2% Copper at an initial temperature of 919.25Â° K. The
plot shows the concentration gradient of the copper around the solid
dendrite. As the aluminum crystallizes first, the liquid phase next to
the dendrite exhibits a higher Cu concentration.

The parallel implementation was carried out with LibGeoDecomp.
