VisIt has been used on the NCSA Blue Waters supercomputer to visualize output
from CASTRO, a massively parallel, finite-volume, adaptive mesh refinement
(AMR) code. The plot shows a volume-rendering of magnitude of vorticity, a
measure of turbulence, which helps identify a "bubble" within the supernova.
