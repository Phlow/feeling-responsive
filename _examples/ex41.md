Eruptive conduits feeding volcanic jets and plumes are connected to the
atmosphere through volcanic vents that, depending on their size and 3D
shape, can alter the dynamics and structure of these eruptions. The host
rock comprising the vent, in turn, can collapse, fracture, and erode in
response to the eruptive flow field. These visualizations illustrate
results from fully coupled numerical simulations of high speed,
multiphase volcanic mixtures erupting through erodible, visco-plastic
host rocks. This work explores the influence of different host rock
rheologies, computational approximations, and eruptive conditions on the
development of simulated volcanic jets.

The movies show the dependence of lithic segregation in the plume on
eruption pressure. Host rock and erupted ash mix into the center of
eruptions with moderate to low pressure, i.e., less expansion. Host rock
is entrained into the outer regions of eruptions with higher pressure,
and fine ash mixes throughout the column.
