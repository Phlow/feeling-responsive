This snapshot was taken from a movie based on data from a
Rayleigh-Bénard convection simulation. The system is a fluid heated
from below and cooled from above with periodic sidewalls and
impermeable horizontal plates. The visible quantity is the
temperature of the fluid, where red and blue indicate hot and cold
fluid, respectively. Using the volume rendering with ray casting and
an opacity profile dependent on the temperature, the mean
temperature has been made transparent. This results in the
temperature extrema being clearly visible and the possibility to see
through the system, revealing the 3D structure. One can clearly
distinguish the small scale thermal plumes and the large scale
circulation, both characteristic coherent structures in this type of flow.
