State-of-the-art metal 3D printers promise to revolutionize manufacturing, yet
they have not reached optimal operational reliability. The challenge is to
control complex laser–powder–melt pool interdependency (dependent upon each
other) dynamics. We used high-fidelity simulations, coupled with synchrotron
experiments, to capture fast multitransient dynamics at the meso-nanosecond
scale and discovered new spatter-induced defect formation mechanisms that depend
on the scan strategy and a competition between laser shadowing and expulsion. We
derived criteria to stabilize the melt pool dynamics and minimize defects. This
will help improve build reliability.
