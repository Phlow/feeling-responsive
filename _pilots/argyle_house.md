The pilot involves installing Estimote beacons on chairs in eight large 'public' spaces on the floors of Argyle House that are occupied by the University's Information Services. The beacons contain heat sensors and accelerometers, and will provide data about whether a chair is being used. The data from groups of chairs will be sent via [Bluetooth low energy (BLE)](https://www.bluetooth.com/what-is-bluetooth-technology/bluetooth-technology-basics/low-energy) to a Sensor Hub, which will integrate the data and send it via ethernet for further processing. 

There will be a total of 83 hubs and 140 chair sensor kits. This project is likely to start in November 2016.
