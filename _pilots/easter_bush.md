This pilot will use motion or contact sensors for gathering quantitative data on frequency, time of use and door closure behaviours on fume cupboards used in scientific laboratories. It forms part of a larger effort, namely 
the [Enhance living lab project](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/enhanced/) on energy reduction in non-domestic buildings.  This interactive co-design and co-creational project has many stages &mdash;  from October 2016 it is identifying and gathering the data required to inform the living lab participants of current practices and behaviours that impact on energy use.
