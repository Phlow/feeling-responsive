The proposal is to install a variety of sensors in different kinds of student spaces in order to determine occupancy levels. Our current plan is to proceed with this in Semester 2, after Argyle House project is underway. We are considering two options: (i) Centre for Research Collections (CRC), which is already quite a controlled space on the top floor of the library, and (ii) some or all of the small group study pods. 
The information would be made available to students via a display screen in the foyer and/or via an app. We hope to be able to put a draft proposal to the Library Committee in October 2016.
