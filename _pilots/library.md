teaser: "Tracking occupancy in student study spaces"
---

This pilot will install chair sensor kits similar to those described in the [Argyle House pilot]({{ site.url }}/pilots/argyle_house). We will use these in different kinds of student spaces in order to determine occupancy levels. We are currently considering two kinds of space: 

* The Centre for Research Collection, which is already quite a controlled space on the top floor of the library, 
* Some or all of the small group study pods. 

Real-time information about occupancy could be made available to students *via* a display screen in the library foyer or via an app.
