This tutorial demonstrates basic functionality of VisIt's keyframing feature
to produce powerful movies with relative ease. In this demonstration, multile
aspects of the visualization are animated simulatneously including the database
time-state, the view (rotation and zoom) and a plot's attributes.

Some of the aspects of the keyframing window are difficult to master and the
interface is still somewhat idiosyncratic. However, setting these minor issues
aside, it is possible to create fairly sophisticated animation sequnences with
VisIt's keyframing feature.
