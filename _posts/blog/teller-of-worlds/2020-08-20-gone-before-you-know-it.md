## Day 10: Gone Before You Know It
*[Inspired by this reply to a post!](https://pro2.akimbo.com/t/imperfect-emergence/28826/5?u=mtfallsvr)* 

Coming towards the end of my short read of *The House on Mango Street*, the author makes a sweet note in remembrance of her mother. In what seemed originally seemed like a simple evening gazing at the stars, the author had no idea that this would be the last time she would ever do something like this with mother. Everytime something reminds me of the inevitability of death, I start to get uneasy. I begin to worry about all the people I care about in my life, if the last way I departed with them was good enough should it *really* have been the last time. Being still so young, I can't even fathom what wreck of emotions will overcome me when the time comes where I must lose my parents, lose my dog, lose anyone around me that I will never be able to hold again. Sometimes I stare at simple things like my car and become overwhelmed by a resurgence of memories of all the places I have been, all the people I have been with, all the things we have done together, and smile weakly because those brilliant instances came and went. The only solace in all this inevitable loss is that there is always more to be gained, but only if we keep striving towards the future. 

And so I hold each moment of everyday in my hand, grateful that it had the opportunity to pass through my life.
