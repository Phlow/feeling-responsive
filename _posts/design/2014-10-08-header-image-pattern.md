It's so easy to do. Just define in front matter an image and a pattern image. Instead of a pattern you can also use a color. Have a look at the [example with a background color]({{ site.url }}/design/header-image-color/).


## Front Matter Code

header:
    image:  "header_unsplash_2-970x.jpg"
    pattern:  "pattern_concrete.jpg"
    caption: This is a caption for the header image with link
    caption_url: https://unsplash.com/
