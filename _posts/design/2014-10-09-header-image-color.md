It's so easy to do. Just define in front matter an image and a background color. Instead of a color you can also use a pattern image. Have a look at the [example with a background pattern]({{ site.url }}/design/header-image-pattern/).

## Front Matter Code

<div class="alert-box radius alert">WARNING: To make this work the value of <em>background-color</em> must be inbetween quotes.</div>

header:
    image:  "header_unsplash_2-970x.jpg"
    background-color:  "#fabb00"
    caption: This is a caption for the header image with link
