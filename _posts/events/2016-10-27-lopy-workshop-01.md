The [LoPy](https://www.pycom.io/solutions/py-boards/lopy/) micro-controller is an innovative device that supports LoRa, Wifi and BLE. Two members of the Pycom team will lead a hands-on workshop to get you started on programming the LoPy, and show you how to send sensor data from the board to a LoRa gateway. The workshop will run 14:00-16:00 on Thursday 27th October, in the Design Informatics Studio, Evolution House.

The workshop is now fully booked, but you can [register for the waitlist on Eventbrite](https://iot-lopy-workshop.eventbrite.co.uk).

In order to benefit from the workshop, you should already have a working knowledge of Python. You will also need to bring your own laptop &mdash; please install the [Pymakr IDE](https://www.pycom.io/solutions/pymakr/) before coming to the workshop.
