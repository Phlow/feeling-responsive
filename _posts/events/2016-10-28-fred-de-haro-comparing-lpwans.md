Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWANs) are being widely promoted for IoT deployment, with LoRa, Sigfox and LTE-M amongst the leading contenders to win the technology race. For developers, a persistent question is "what’s the best wireless network for this or that type of connected application?" In this talk, Fred de Haro will present Pycom’s views on “the race” and will explain the defining characteristics of these competing LPWAN technologies and their suitability for different IoT use-cases.
