*In the context of a city-wide network for the Internet of Things, what connections can be made that link together civic, cultural and private activities to foster an open innovation culture?*

LoRa wireless systems are opening up the ways we can pass data and communicate across the city. This Collider will bring together different organisations from across Edinburgh to see how we can work together and come up with creative solutions.

A collider is a conceptual design event, bringing together computational thinking and design thinking, to pull informaticians together with designers, and problem holders. The first part of the Collider sets the scene before breaking out into workshop sessions.
