In preparing an author bio (harder than it sounds!) for a PHPList book I&#8217;ve been authoring, I dug up this old copy of a <a title="JAJC Manual" href="http://jajc.jrudevels.org/" target="_blank">JAJC</a> (a win32 jabber client) manual I wrote in 2003, using Docbook XML.

It&#8217;s probably no longer valid, but here it is anyway, for posterity <img src="https://www.funkypenguin.co.nz/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /> [JAJC Manual][1]
