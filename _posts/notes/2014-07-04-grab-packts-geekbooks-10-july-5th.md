The folks at [Packt Publishing][1] asked me to mention that they&#8217;re having [10 years $10][1] special, to celebrate their 10-year anniversary. Their entire range of books (geared towards niche geek topics) are available for $10 each. This is a good opportunity to brush up on some rusty areas, or establish a new skillset.

They&#8217;ve offered me 2 ebooks in return for mentioning this, but even if they hadn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d still endorse the opportunity to upskill yourself at roughly 50% off. I have my eye on the following:

  * [phpList 2 Email Campaign Manager 2][2] (a bit outdated now that phpList 3 is released and reskinned, but the underlying concepts are still useful)
  * [Network Analysis using Wireshark Cookbook][3]
  * [Sparrow iOS Game Framework Beginnerâ€™s Guide][4]
  * [OpenStack Cloud Computing Cookbook &#8211; Second Edition][5]
