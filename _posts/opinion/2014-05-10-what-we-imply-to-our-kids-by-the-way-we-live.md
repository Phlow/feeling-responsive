I enjoyed [Minimalism with Kids][1], finding several point re minimalism and life in general which I intend to apply.

This paragraph stood out:

> In a family, minimalism is really a conversation about what’s important. What’s necessary. Why we own things and do things. A lot of times, a family never really has this conversation — it’s all just implied in the way we live.

I&#8217;ve been trying to think more consciously about what we teach our kids with our unconscious routines and habits &#8211; this was a good reminder. I think today my son and I will clean out my closet!
