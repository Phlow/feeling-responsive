Against the author&#8217;s wishes, I&#8217;m sharing the article titled &#8220;[Actually Reading][1]&#8220;, a comment on the fact that we (I&#8217;m guilty of this) often appreciate an article for it social &#8220;sharability&#8221; rather than the value it adds to us.

I&#8217;m trying to combat this in my own reading by (like in this post) at least adding semi-intelligent comment to the process of sharing something I enjoyed and would recommend to friends.
