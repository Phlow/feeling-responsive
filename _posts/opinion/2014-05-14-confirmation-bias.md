I read Shane Parrish&#8217;s mental model on [confirmation bias][1] this evening, and found it resonated with me. I&#8217;ve notice that once I&#8217;ve struggled with a decision and come to a conclusion, **then** I find myself coming up with more and more reasons why my decision was the right one.
