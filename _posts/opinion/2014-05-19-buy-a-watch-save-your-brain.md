Jeremy Vandehey points out in &#8220;[This is your brain on mobile][1]&#8221; that buying a watch can reduce the amount of time you spend distracted on your smartphone, since you won&#8217;t be whipping it out to check the time, only to repeat a few min later because you&#8217;ve forgotten. (this totally happens to me!) I&#8217;m holding out for the [rumored iWatch][2] before making any purchasing decisions though.
