I enjoyed [Rian van der Merwe][1]&#8216;s first column on [A List Apart][2], in which he defends a traditional view of work-life balance. The following echoes my own policy &#8211; I try to be 100% **at work** during work hours, but afterwards, I&#8217;m **0%** at work (crises and extraordinary circumstances excluded)

> I have a weird rule about this. Work has me—completely—between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. It has 100 percent of my attention. But outside of those hours I consider it part of being a sane and good human to give my kids a bath, chat to my wife, read, and reflect on the day that’s past and the one that’s coming—without the pressure of having to be online all the time

And the following:

> But I don’t sit and do email for hours every night. See, the time I spend with people is what gives my work meaning. I do what I do for them—for the people in my life, the people I know, and the people I don’t. If we never spend time away from our work, how can we understand the world and the people we make things for?

One of the comments on Riaan&#8217;s article mentions the benefits of a &#8220;flexible understanding&#8221; with one&#8217;s employer, allowing the flexibility to look after family situations (kids to school or the doctor), and I&#8217;m fortunate that my industry and my employer tend to allow these, since so much of our critical work is done outside of normal working hours.
