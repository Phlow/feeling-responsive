In &#8220;[Buy a watch, save your brain][1]&#8220;, I wrote about how I hoped to buy a wrist watch (at the time, it was the rumoured &#8220;iWatch&#8221;), and reduce the amount of distraction I caused myself each time I checked the time on my iPhone.

Well, the &#8220;Apple Watch&#8221; announcement has come and gone, and (admittedly) after the hype wore off, I realised that I don&#8217;t really want the Apple Watch, for the following reasons:

  * I want a waterproof watch. I have a small child. Enough said.
  * I want an affordable watch
  * I want a watch, which is a fitness tracker, which monitors my sleep, which means..
  * I want a watch with a battery that doesn&#8217;t have to be charged every night
  * Apple Pay is unlikely to be a big deal in New Zealand, ever

So after much research, I bought myself the [Pebble Smartwatch][2].

As it turns out, my timing was almost perfect. Although Pebble has been around for more than 2 years, it&#8217;s only recently (as in the last few weeks), that it finally meets all my criteria.

  * Pebble [Firmware 2.6][3] was released, adding background activity tracking
  * Pebble dropped the price of the Pebble watch from $149 to $99
  * Pebble Firmware 2.5+ and iOS8 combined for reliable connectivity and dismissible notifications

(Note: I actually ordered my pebble **before** the price drop, but Pebble were good enough to [refund me $50][4] on the purchase price. I promptly used this to buy a second Pebble watch for a geeky friend).

I did seriously consider the Pebble Steel, but at the time it was $250, and I decided against it because of the difficulty of obtaining aftermarket straps in New Zealand, and a fear that the sharp buttons would scratch my kids when I wrestle them (my dad used to have to take his watch off before he wrestled us). The one benefit of the Steel that I missed out on was the Gorilla Glass screen, but I&#8217;ve ordered a set of [GadgetWraps&#8217; Screen Protectors][5] to hopefully protect the plastic screen a bit.

It&#8217;s been only a couple of days, and while there are some minor issues ([MisFit app sync][6], I&#8217;m looking at you), on the whole I&#8217;m very happy with my decision, and have already noticed a decline in my smartphone habit.

So which faces / apps am I currently using on my Pebble? (there&#8217;s a limit of 8 slots for faces / apps)

  * [Modern watchface][7] &#8211; I like the bold, chunky style
  * [Mickey Mouse watchface][8] &#8211; My son loves Mickey
  * [Plex Remote][9] &#8211; I can control my media center from my watch!
  * [Evernote][10] &#8211; Check-able checklists are great for avoiding having to whip out the smart phone while grocery shopping
  * [Misfit][11] &#8211; Sync issues aside, it&#8217;s great to have an activity/automatic sleep tracker
  * [SimonRemote][12] &#8211; I can control iTunes/Spotify on my mac from my watch!
  * [Pbfoscam][13] &#8211; I&#8217;d hoped this would let me display snapshots from my IP cameras, but I haven&#8217;t managed to get it working yet)
  * The [Weather Channel App][14] &#8211; Having a 3-day forecast on my wrist is useful
