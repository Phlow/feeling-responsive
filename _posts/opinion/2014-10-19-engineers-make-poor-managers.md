**Update**: after a back-and-forth with Lindsay, this post should more accurately be titled &#8220;Good engineer != good manager&#8221;

In [It&#8217;s not a promotion &#8211; it&#8217;s a career change][1], [Lindsay Holmwood][2] explains why so many engineers &#8220;promoted&#8221; to management do such a poor job..

> The truth of the matter is this: you are woefully unprepared for a career in management, and you are unaware of how badly unprepared you are.

Among the reasons for the above are how devalued the &#8220;soft&#8221; skills are, among the tech industry, and how often we underestimate how much we don&#8217;t know, while overestimating our existing competencies (the Dunning-Kruger effect).

[Read the whole article][1] for a deep analysis, plus some tips for making the aforementioned &#8220;career change&#8221;..
