I just jumped in at the end of a conversation on App.net about the latest NSA revelation, the [undermining of worldwide encryption standards][1] for the benefit of the self-appointed world-police. [@isaiah][2] pointed out that we (geekdom in general) don&#8217;t get as excited about civilian casualties in Iraq, or unsanctioned drone strikes.

I decided to react by setting up a Tor relay on my VPS, contributing a little bandwidth and capacity to the [Tor Project][3]{.broken_link}, which allows anyone to bypass censorship and surveillance (at the cost of speed, currently). Â It took about 30 (fun) minutes to setup on Debian, and the process is well-documented at [Setup a Tor relay][4].

While there&#8217;s not much I can do to prevent drone strikes and abuses of power, enabling and supporting ongoing efforts to thwart oppression and overreaching authority seems like time well spent.
