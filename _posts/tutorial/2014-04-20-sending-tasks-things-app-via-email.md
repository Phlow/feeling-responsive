I stumbled across this useful hint on the <a title="Things forums" href="https://culturedcode.com/forums/read.php?8,57893" target="_blank">Things forums</a> which adds a feature to my workflow which I felt important enough to record here.

Most of my digital inputs come via email. It&#8217;s hugely useful to be able to (with a single keystroke) forward an email to my Evernote inbox, but being unable to do the same to send a task to Things was creating some friction.

The easy answer -

  1. Enable Siri imports in Things app on iOS
  2. Setup free IFTTT app on iOS
  3. Setup an Email->Reminders recipe in IFTTT

Any emails you send to your trigger@ifttt.com account will appear in your Reminders on iOS, and will show up automatically in your Things inbox, ready for import.
