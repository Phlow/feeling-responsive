We&#8217;re upgrading our Asterisk PABX at the office soon, as as part of the preparation, I needed a way to automatically reboot about 20 Cisco 79xx IP phones.

I found a reference to a &#8216;reboot.pl&#8217; script at http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/Asterisk+phone+cisco+79xx, but the link is dead.

Thanks to the excellent [Resurrect Pages][1] Firefox plugin, I found an old copy of the script from 2012. For posterity, I&#8217;ve archived it at [Github][2]. YMMV.
