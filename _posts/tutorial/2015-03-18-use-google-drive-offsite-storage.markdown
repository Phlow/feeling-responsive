OK, so the purpose of this post is to see what happens if I create a post without any fancy stuff

Mmm.. so that's not bad. It still produces a good result. No category though.

## Let's try a subheading

Well, this is my subsectino. Here's a bit of code now:

{% highlight bash %}
echo "hello bob"
for i in 1-9
do
    echo $i
done
{% endhighlight %}
