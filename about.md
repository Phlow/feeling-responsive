## I got inspired by...

[Michael Rose][1] and his fabulous [themes for jekyll][2].  
Authors of [A List Apart][4] and [Smashing Magazine][5] since 2002.  
[GitHub][6] and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide.   
[Automattic][3] and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress.  


And of course many more...

**Since then, fork it!**

Yours sincerelly, [Moritz »mo.« Sauer][7]
