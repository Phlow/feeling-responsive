...and learn at the same time.

*Feeling Responsive* is my first theme and let into the world. It's built on work and knowledge of others. While I am still programming it, you read about whats behind this theme in the – hopefully – near future.

I got inspired by...

[Michael Rose][1] and his fabulous [themes for jekyll][2].  
Authors of [A List Apart][4] and [Smashing Magazine][5] since 2002.  
[GitHub][6] and how they built such a habitat for cooperation worldwide.   
[Automattic][3] and how they built a fantastic community around WordPress.  


And of course many more...

**Since then, fork it!**

Yours sincerelly, Moritz »mo.« Sauer
