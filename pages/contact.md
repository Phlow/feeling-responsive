Methods of contact we offer differ in *requirements* and *privacy* level. In
addition, while we try to accommodate a variety of means of *initial contact*,
any issues involving *ongoing dialog* must use only a *preferred* method of
communication. Please read about our
[communication policies](https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/develop/dev_manual/SiteReliabilityEngineering.html#supported-methods-of-contact) for more details.

### More details

More recently, we have been
[trying get away from plain ole' email](https://github.com/visit-dav/live-customer-response/wiki/How-the-new-GitHub-visit-users-Email-Integration-Works)
in favor of GitHub issues and for this reason would prefer users contact
us through our [GitHub issue tracker][gh1] whenever possible.

In general, coverage is during normal West Coast business hours, 8am-12pm and
1-5pm (GMT-8, San Francisco time zone), Monday through Friday excluding
[LLNL holidays](https://supplychain.llnl.gov/poattach/pdf/llnl_holidays.pdf)
and response time may be as much as four hours due to team members multi-tasking
among many responsibilities.

If you are so inclined, we welcome you to read more about the VisIt project's
[Site Reliability Engineering](https://visit-sphinx-github-user-manual.readthedocs.io/en/develop/dev_manual/SiteReliabilityEngineering.html)
processes to understand how we aim to respond to inquiries.
