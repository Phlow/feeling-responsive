# Timeseries Data Exploration Project

## Highlights

* Project focused on a timeseries data exploration web app that was used to find similar subsections within a timeseries dataset. The application was designed to use clustering to reduce the computational requirements of the task. 
* Benchmarked the app by using Docker and AWS Batch to run experiments on AWS hardware. 
* Created a UI for using the app, including a query entry system as well as a viewer for the timeseries and the results. 

## Technologies Used
* Python
* Cloud computing tools including: AWS Lambda, AWS API Gateway, and AWS Batch
* Django and React
* Docker
