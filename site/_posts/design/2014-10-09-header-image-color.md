It's so easy to do. Just define in front matter an image and a background color. Instead of a color you can also use a pattern image. Have a look at the [example with a background pattern]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/design/header-image-pattern/).

## Front Matter Code

{% include alert alert="WARNING: To make this work the value of `background-color` must be inbetween quotes." %}

header:
    image: "header_unsplash_2-970x.jpg"
    background-color: "#fabb00"
    caption: This is a caption for the header image with link
