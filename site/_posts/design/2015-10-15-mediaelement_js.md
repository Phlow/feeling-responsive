[mediaelement.js][1] is like magic. It's browser and device support is perfect. To activate the video or audio player just set the following variable in front matter to `true`.

~~~
mediaplayer: true
~~~

To use the player just use some HTML5-magic like...

{% highlight html %}
<audio src="http://path-to-file.com/music.mp3" type="audio/mp3" controls="controls"></audio>
{% endhighlight %}

All possible functions and how to use *mediaelement.js* is well-documented on the [players website][1].
